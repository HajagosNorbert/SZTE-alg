# University Algorithms & Datastructures class

This is where I put the algorithms that I write based on the problem description our professor gives.

I try to *actually* solve these problems, not just copy in some code from a textbook / internet.

If I feel really thorough, or I need greater understanding, I will write extended doc-comments as a means to ramble out the explanation to myself.
