# University Algorithms & Data Structures class

This is where I put the algorithms that I write based on the problem description our professor gives.

I try to *actually* solve these problems, not just copy in some code from a textbook / internet.

If I feel really thorough, or I need greater understanding, I will write extended doc-comments as a means to ramble out the explanation to myself.

## What's inside?
 1. Combinatorical algs

## How to use?
 
This is low effort stuff. Look at the code, uncomment the parts in main you don't want to run. 

if you have the go toolchain installed run:

```sh
go run gyak[lecture-number].go
```
